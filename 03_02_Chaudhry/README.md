**Summary:** When it comes to organizational transgressions, amends-making in the public eye serves to affect an organization’s reputation, and thus, subsequent success. Since previous work on amends-making has focused on interpersonal conflicts, little is known about the efficacy of organizational amends-making strategies in repairing audience satisfaction. We address this gap by looking at the effectiveness of amends-making strategies in two datasets of manager responses to service failures. In a dataset of hotel manager responses to customer complaints on TripAdvisor, we use a data-driven approach to identify five components of amends-making strategies used by managers: public apology, corrective action, responsibility acknowledgement, explanation, and counteroffensive strategy. Using structural equation modeling, we find that only corrective actions (e.g., offering to repair a situation or promising change) and public apologies positively predicted audience satisfaction. We further verified the causal relationships between each of the five individual factors that we identified above and audience satisfaction by using a quasi-experimental matching technique (to minimize covariation) based on a combination of propensity score and Euclidean distance. In a second dataset of manager responses to service failures on Twitter, we are currently examining whether the presence of explicit apologies in manager responses impacts outcomes like company mentions and the sentiment of audience replies. In sum, this paper seeks to offer empirically supported guidelines for organizations who aim to repair audience perceptions following a transgression as well as providing theoretical insight into how to repair organizational violations of trust.

**Shereen Chaudhry** Shereen Chaudhry studies how people navigate social interactions and relationships with others by examining patterns in how people use language and speech acts when they communicate with one another. In some cases, she applies the lens of game theory to better understand how people subtly coordinate (or fail to coordinate) in conversations. She is interested in the downstream consequences these behaviors have in contexts important for organizations like conflict management, negotiations, teamwork, and customer satisfaction. Her education and research training at the intersection of psychology, economics, and neuroscience.
