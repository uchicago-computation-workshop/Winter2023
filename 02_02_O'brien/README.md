**Summary:** Daily life occurs at multiple scales. We operate in a “community” and the people and institutions therein. We interface with neighbors on our street. We spend the most time in our own homes. This multilayered complexity of social geography has important implications for our experiences and outcomes, from the “neighborhood effects” familiar to social scientists to microspatial inequities arising from disparities from street to street. Understanding the interplay between these scales is newly accessible thanks to the emergent field of urban informatics—that is, the use of cutting-edge data and technology to better understand and serve communities. This talk will leverage work by the Boston Area Research Initiative at Northeastern University to capture this opportunity. It will begin by using the study of problem properties to illustrate the complementarity between communities and their places. It will then extend these lessons to environmental justice and the impacts of heat, air pollution, and flooding. It will conclude by proposing implications for how we might design 21st century communities whose planning, programs, and policies effectively engage this multilayered complexity.

**Dan O’Brien** Dr. Daniel T. O’Brien is a leader of the burgeoning field of “urban informatics”, which uses modern digital data to better understand and serve local communities. He is Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs and the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University and Director of the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), an interuniversity center that is an international model for advancing place-based, civically-engaged research that leverages data to benefit local communities..

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Rm 107 of Kent Hall.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, February 1 @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
