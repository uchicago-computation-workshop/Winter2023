**Summary:** What is a group? How do we know to which groups we belong? How do we assign others to groups? A great deal of theorizing across the social sciences has conceptualized ‘groups’ as synonymous with ‘categories,’ however there are a number of limitations to this approach: particularly for making predictions about novel intergroup contexts or about how intergroup dynamics will change over time. Here I present two projects that offer alternative frameworks for thinking about these questions. First I review some recent work elucidating the cognitive processes that give rise to the inference of coalitions (even in the absence of category labels). Then I'll discuss an ongoing project on the effects of social group reference dependence--which falls out of coalitional reasoning--on hate crimes in the U.S. between 1990 and 2010.

**Mina Cikara** Professor Cikara studies how the mind, brain, and behavior change when the social context shifts from “me and you” to “us and them.” She focuses primarily on how group membership, competition, and prejudice disrupt the processes that allow people to see others as human and to empathize with others. She uses a wide range of tools—standard laboratory experiments, implicit and explicit behavioral measures, fMRI and psychophysiology—to examine failures of empathy, dehumanization, and misunderstanding between groups. She is equally interested in the behavioral consequences of these processes: discrimination, conflict, and harm.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Rm 107 of Kent Hall.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, February 8th @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
